## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")
 
What makes you grumpy?

- Carelessness: I expect that everyone, at the very least, care about what they're doing, and how
- The Debating Society Mindset: when choosing what to do or how to do it, leveraging rethoric or trying to win the argument by shouting louder than the rest will not get brownie points from me
- Groundhog Day Syndrome: if a team is repeating the same mistakes over and over again, I become unhappy

How will I know when you’re grumpy?

- Either you, or your manager, will get this information directly

How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

- Learning stuff! Trying out a new technology, or a novel way to do things, will help. e.g.: I had a long session with a colleague doing stuff around [Elixir remote types](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html#remote-types) and that absorbed me 100%.

How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

- In general my introverted nature makes me prefer asynchronous communication (but beware when using an email, I can easily miss it or not read it in a timely fashion). That said, any form of feedback is good!

How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

- I want it as fresh as possible!

How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

- I'm ok with both but please warn me privately before a public shout-out.

What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

- When I can get the overview of the wider challenges and objectives, and see that top level view of how my role can help. Also, digging into a juicy challenge, I love that! 

What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

- In the next 3 months, I want to make sure we retain and bootstrap the developers that joined the company I work for
- This year, I want to become a lot more proficient at mentoring and coaching!

What do you need from your manager?

- Autonomy
- Clear objectives
- Robust feedback when I'm doing something too far away from the beaten path (that said, I will get a JavaScript alternative in our stack!)

From your team?

- Trust (whatever I suggest or push for is always an attempt to improve things for everyone)
- Honesty and openness

From your peers? (outside the team)

- Open feedback
- New ideas on how to tackle everyday's problems

What’s your favourite baked good?

- Treat me to pizza and you'll make me happy.
