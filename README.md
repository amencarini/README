# Alessandro's Operating Manual

## Communication

- üåç While I try my best with English, remember I'm not a native speaker! Please don't get upset if I ask you to repeat things
- üì¢ I show the symptoms of a mild [auditory processing disorder](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/). I won't be a very effective conversationalist in very noisy environments. Also, loud music in the office is a certain way to mess up my productivity üò≠

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")
 
What makes you grumpy?

- Carelessness: I expect that everyone, at the very least, care about what they're doing, and how
- The Debating Society Mindset: when choosing what to do or how to do it, leveraging rethoric or trying to win the argument by shouting louder than the rest will not get brownie points from me
- Groundhog Day Syndrome: if a team is repeating the same mistakes over and over again, I become unhappy

How will I know when you‚Äôre grumpy?

- You most likely will get this information directly

How can I help you when you‚Äôre grumpy?

- Learning stuff! Trying out a new technology, or a novel way to do things, will help.

How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

- In general my introverted nature makes me prefer asynchronous communication (but beware when using an email, I can easily miss it or not read it in a timely fashion). That said, any form of feedback is good!

How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

- I want it as fresh as possible!

How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

- I'm ok with both but if possible please warn me privately before a public shout-out.

What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

- When I can get the overview of the wider challenges and objectives, and see that top level view of how my role can help. Also, digging into a juicy challenge, I love that! 

What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

- In the next 3 months, I want to become a productive and valuable member of the team. Sounds easier than it is given everyone's skill level!
- This year, I want to skill up as much as I can after a period of relative stagnation

What do you need from your manager?

- Autonomy
- Clear objectives
- Robust feedback when I'm doing something too far away from the beaten path

From your team?

- Trust (whatever I suggest or push for is always an attempt to improve things for everyone)
- Honesty and openness

From your peers? (outside the team)

- Open feedback
- New ideas on how to tackle everyday's problems

What‚Äôs your favourite baked good?

- I'm trying to lose weight, so... But good pizza never fails to cheer me up
